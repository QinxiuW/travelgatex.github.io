      <description>Hotels in test Do I have access to all the hotels in the test environment?
No, since we use a test supplier, there is a limited number of hotels in the database to be used.
Languages allowed Which are the languages allowed in HotelX?
The new aggregator allows every language, but the languages for the results to be returned will depend on the information returned from each supplier.
Maximum hotel codes How many hotels code are allowed to be requested at the same time?</description>
