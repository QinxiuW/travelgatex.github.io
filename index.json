	"content": " Hotels in test Do I have access to all the hotels in the test environment?\nNo, we use a test supplier, so there is a limited number of hotels in the database to be used.\nLanguages allowed Which are the languages allowed in HotelX?\nThe new aggregator allows every language, it will depend from each supplier.\nMaximum hotels code How many hotels code are allowed to be requested at the same time?\nWe recommend a maximum of 200 hotels, the new aggregator will split them for each supplier into different batches in order to request all the hotels. Please take note: The current formula and rate limit are subject to change.\nClient Nationality Are there any restrictions to the client\u0026rsquo;s nationality?\nIt depends on the supplier\nDoes the client\u0026rsquo;s nationality affect the price? - For instance, same Search criteria with different client nationality\nYes, nationality and market might affect the price of the option, depending on the supplier.\nAge Range of Children - Infants How can we differentiate a child from an infant? What is the age range of each of them?\nEach supplier has their own restrictions, so it will depend on each supplier.\nSearch request filters What is the function of an accessCode?\nEvery time you activate a supplier, you receive an access code. This access code is used to differentiate between suppliers and also to filter between the same supplier\u0026rsquo;s different credentials and configurations.\nWhich are the possible filters in the Search Request?\nRight now, you can search by hotel code and by destination. In the future, it will be possible to request by Geocode.\nThe main search methods will be:\n Hotel code Destination Geocode (Coming soon)  GIATA codes It is possible to use GIATA codes?\nYes, it is possible to request availability using GIATA codes. First of all, you wil need to provide us your GIATA credentials in order to set up your Apikey. After that, you will be able to request using GIATA codes, receive the availability responses with GIATA codes, etc.\nCountry names How can I get the names of the countries?\nThe response of the HotelX Query contains location.country in ISO standard format.\nDaily-prices Can I get Daily-prices in Search Response?\nIt will depend if the supplier offers the information. In case that the information is returned by the supplier, you will find it through the Roomprice string\u0026ndash;\u0026gt;PriceBreakdown.\nCurrency in Search Requests Is it necessary to include the currency attribute in your Search Request?\nIn these cases, you will have two options:\n If you don\u0026rsquo;t include any currency, then the settings\u0026rsquo; default currency configuration will be used If you don\u0026rsquo;t configure a currency conversion plugin, then default supplier currency is returned. Some suppliers accept currency parameter and others will return their currency depending on your account as client with them.  Currency not supported What happen if I request availability with a currency that the supplier doesn´t accept?\nIn these cases, you will have two options:\n Applying the exchange rates using a plugin (this pluggin contains the exchange rates previously loaded by you) Not applying any exchange rate and you will receive the supplier´s currency.  Cancellation costs Is it possible to perform a cancellation as a query to just retrieve the cancellation costs, but not to cancel the booked item itself?\nYou will be able to check the booking information (cancel policies included) with the HotelBooking query.\nResponse time How is the response time of the different providers managed in the aggregator mode?\nHotelX will return the information from all the suppliers at the same time, once all the responses have been obtained by them. As for the requests that have timed out, they will be signaled by a warning in the response.\nTime out In aggregator mode, is it possible to set a time out for each provider?\nNo, the time out will be applied to all providers, using the parameter setting: timeout.\nContent How to Manage HotelX Content\nHotelX allows two types of Queries:\n Search to a HotelCode level: in order to receive the information of a specific HotelCode(s), you should introduce the HotelCode(s) of your query:  { \u0026quot;criteria\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;access\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;yourAccess\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hotelCodes\u0026quot;:[\u0026quot;A159\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;B357\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;C568\u0026quot;] } }   Search the complete HotelList from a supplier’s access: in order to receive the complete hotel list from a supplier’s access, you should introduce the number of hotels you want to receive in the response of the query. Since the hotel list includes a large amount of hotels, it is divided into several batches, each one of a different number of hotels. In this case, the minimum size you can request is 100, and the max. is 10000.  { \u0026quot;criteria\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;access\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;yourAccess\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;maxSize\u0026quot;: 500 } }  More info on HotelX content.\n"

Our first API \u0026ndash; HotelX \u0026ndash; is currently available and provides access to over 600 hotel booking suppliers, with thousands of properties available.\n                                                                                                                                                                                       \nThe TravelgateX platform supports both travel buyers and sellers.\nBUYERS are businesses that provide travel services to their customer base.\nBuyers are:\n Online travel agents, Travel apps, Niche travel operators or Direct-to-consumer travel platforms.  As a buyer, you can use the TravelgateX platform and our HotelX API to integrate a wide selection of realtime, hotel bed booking databases into your applications.\nOur buyers first need to have an agreement with the hotel bed supplier in place, and once that has been arranged, you are able to connect to our HotelX API and to begin displaying hotel bed availability directly in your client applications and interfaces.\n\rSELLERS are hotel bed and travel service providers who have an inventory of hotel beds (or travel services) that you want to make available for online booking.\nSellers are:\n \u0026gt;B2B travel aggregators, Travel fare aggregators and travel metasearch engines, Large hotel chains, Travel service catalogues, or Direct-to-consumer travel platforms.  As a seller, TravelgateX connects to your realtime booking databases so that you can optimize your vacancies and make them available to buyers. Where you have made set pricing arrangements with particular buyers, specific pricing is displayed as per your agreements. TravelgateX supports suppliers to reach new buyers by helping make it easy for new buyers to sign up for hotel and travel service contracts via our platform.\nOur HotelX API is now live and able to integrate thousands of hotel beds into your client applications. Check out our roadmap pages for details of our forthcoming APIs, including an optional Speed API to speed up response times and bookings to large hotel databases, our next-generation Mappea mapping API, and APIs that help you track statistics and travel demands so that you have better insight into tourism trends and changing consumer patterns.\r"

	"description": "HotelX Overview",
	"content": " The HotelX API is a powerful accomodation aggregation solution that will speed up your travel websites and apps and expand your catalogue of hotel booking services.\nUsing HotelX, you can improve your hotel search response times and their accuracy by customizing aggregated responses based on your preferred criteria.\nThe below map shows our architecture and the average impact on response rates caused by each layer.\n  Each and every layer described in the this figure is explained as follows:\nGraphQL Gateway Our gateway is the only endpoint to access all of our products. The gateway also manages authentication and authorization of our system. You can read about this, here.\nBusiness Logic We’ve added a new layer of business logic in front of the transformation layer of our API. This fast, totally scalable and flexible layer allows you to overwrite everything at the request level, or to leave it as it is. Our API is completely written in Go and Redis for performance and scalability. You can create additional plugins (in Go) in order to add your own logic or add an extra functionality.\nSome of the functionalities available in the business logic layer include:\n Configuration and access management  Hotel, Room and Board Mappings  Agggregate, Sort \u0026amp; Filter results  Add pricing/markups  Currency Exchange  Plugins   Plugins HotelX allows you to add Plugins to our API.\nA plugin is a piece of code that is executed inside our application.\rThere are a few points in the request lifetime where anyone can develop a plugin. A plugin receives the request or response as an input and outputs the changed request or response.\nPlugins are a core package in the Go Programming language. You can learn more about how to use plugins here.\n\rTransformation Layer The transformation layer takes care of the actual transformation into the Supplier’s specific format and back. It generates requests to the Supplier in an optimal way. (We have learnt how to create optimal connections with suppliers through our years of interacting with them, learning from them and understanding how to send them requests.) Each different Supplier uses a different business logic, and we know exactly which request will be handled most effectively by each Supplier.\nThe transformation layer keeps each and every Supplier integration at the optimal level. Whenever a new version of the Supplier\u0026rsquo;s integration is released, we update our integration. Our team is constantly monitoring the traffic, both automatically and manually in order to make sure the connectivity works.\nOptional Cache Layer Our cache layer, called Speed does exactly what the name says! It is an optional layer that ensures your responses are lightening fast, by creating a cache.\nWe use advanced Machine Learning models to predict how long each cached item will be valid. This takes into account a large number of variables set in the request. The cache is hosted in Google’s BigTable, a “Massively Scalable NoSQL” database, built with performance and scalability in mind.\nSuppliers Each and every Supplier works in a different way. Most use old legacy SOAP APIs and none of them use GraphQL! We have developed integrations for all of them, and we keep them all optimized so that response times are super fast. We are seamlessly connected to more than 600 Suppliers.\nJoin us on Slack to talk with us about how to use HotelX in your websites, apps, and products. You can also send us a Jira service desk request. If you would like any new features or more information in our documentation, send us an issues request.\n\r"

	"content": " This page provides an overview of the TravelgateX platform.\nGraphQL Gateway TravelgateX is the travel API completely based in GraphQL. Unlike many legacy XML Soap APIs, GraphQL enables each client to ask for and receive exactly the data that is needed. Learn more by reading our Learning GraphQL guides.\nOur Gateway is the only endpoint to access all of our APIs. It is written in NodeJS. This makes it fast, stable, secure, fault tolerant and load balanced between many datacenters from four different cloud providers: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Hetzner and TotalUptime.\nUsing the API There are two types of allowed operations in the TravelgateX GraphQL APIs:\n Queries: Queries are \u0026ldquo;read only\u0026rdquo; and are used to get data from our system. For example, getting a list of available hotel vacancies for a particular date and location is a Query Mutations: Mutations change, add or delete the data in our system. For example, making a booking for a vacant hotel room is a Mutation.  GraphQL Endpoint One of the benefits of using GraphQL is that there is only a single endpoint. You can use this endpoint for all the operations you want to perform.\nOur GraphQL API endpoint for all operations is: https://api.travelgatex.com\rCommunicating with the Server To communicate with our GraphQL server, you\u0026rsquo;ll need an access token with the right scopes. You are able to create a token by following the steps mentioned in the Security Overview.\nMaking Requests The best place to test how to make GraphQL queries in TravelgateX is to start with our interactive API Playground. You can also use curl or any other HTTP-speaking library.\nAll LIVE traffic MUST enable GZIP compression in the HTTP header\rAccept-Encoding: gzip  To query GraphQL using curl, make a POST request with a JSON payload. The payload must contain a string called query:\ncurl -X\\ POST\\ -H \u0026quot;Content-Type: application/json\u0026quot; \\ -H \u0026quot;Authorization: Apikey q8ggxpoVDW76Kw918hwnnRvxlZmAP2QZ\u0026quot; \\ --data '{\u0026quot;query\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;{hotelX{searchStatusService{code description}}}\u0026quot;}' \\ --compressed \\ https://api.travelgatex.com  GraphQL Reference There are several ways you can learn more about the full capabilities of our TravelgateX GraphQL data model\n Reference Documentation provides complete reference documentation for all resources, fields and objects in our GraphQL data model (called a Schema).\n API Playground provides an interactive, multi-column schema definition based on the GraphiQL tool, but with many additional features.\n GraphQL-voyager displays our GraphQL API as an interactive relational database-like graph to help you understand the different parent and child tables within our schema.\n Learning GraphQL is a set of resources to get to know GraphQL and to understand our schema.\n  Examples Check out our GraphQL Playground to get started with making your first query and to work thropugh other query examples.\nKeep in mind that it\u0026rsquo;s important to use the correct Headers. If you wish to use test headers, insert \u0026quot;Authorization\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;Apikey q8ggxpoVDW76Kw918hwnnRvxlZmAP2QZ\u0026quot;\n\rYou can easily share your Queries with others by generating a link using the share button available in the API Playground. This share function works as a Pastebin for your GraphQL query and includes the context (endpoint, HTTP headers, open tabs, etc) so you can share exactly what your Playground query setup looks like.\nConventions TravelgateX follows some conventions about schema definition:\n Relay schema implementation Definition of custom scalar types Token Based Authentication  "

	"description": "Learn about settings in HotelX",
	"content": " On this page you will learn more about settings in HotelX.\nWhat are settings? Settings are the common configuration that will be used in order to build the request to the supplier/s.\nThere are two kind of settings, overridable and partially overridable. You can find the partially overridable settings in the first level of settings and are known as HotelX_Settings. These settings are formed by some non-overridable settings such as \u0026ldquo;group\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;testMode\u0026rdquo;, some overridable global settings such as \u0026ldquo;timeout\u0026rdquo;, \u0026ldquo;auditTransactions\u0026rdquo;, etc., and some overridable baseSettings such as \u0026ldquo;businessRules\u0026rdquo;.\nWe have several levels of settings that can be combined in order to build customised settings. The hierarchy of heritage and type of settings for each level is:\n0 - Criteria common settings fields (currency, auditTransactions, businessRules, etc.)\n1 - Access Settings [Base Settings]\n2 - Supplier Settings [Base Settings]\n3 - Query Settings [HotelX Settings]\n4 - Database Access Settings [Base Settings]\n5 - Database Supplier Settings [Base Settings]\n6 - Database Client Settings [Default Settings]\n7 - Database Group Settings [Default Settings]\nAny field that is empty in one level, will be filled in with the value of the following level.\nA special case is input fields specified in Criteria: if one field of Criteria is specified in settings, the value of Criteria is the most significant. It is mandatory that after the settings heritage flow, each field of Default Settings will be filled, because these settings will be sent to supplier.\nWhere can Settings be applied? Settings can be applied to the following operations:\nQueries These queries have the same settings configuration Click here to see configuration\n Search\n Search setting example  Quote\n Quote setting example  Booking List\n Booking List setting example   Mutations These mutations have the same settings configuration Click here to see configuration\n Book\n Example : Book setting example  Cancel\n Example : Quote setting example    Should you need to modify any fields of the database Settings, please contact with our support team. Please find an example of each type of the settings above:\nHotelX Settings Query/Mutation settings\n\u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;group\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;HotelX_test\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;client\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;xtg\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;context\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;HOTELTEST\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;testMode\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;timeout\u0026quot;: 18000, \u0026quot;language\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;es\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;suppliers\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;code\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;HOTELTEST\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;auditTransactions\u0026quot;: true }, \u0026quot;accesses\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;accessId\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;currency\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;EUR\u0026quot; } } ] } ] }  Base Settings Access or supplier settings (from Query or database)\n\u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;timeout\u0026quot;: 300, \u0026quot;auditTransactions\u0026quot;: true, \u0026quot;businessRules\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;optionsQuota\u0026quot;: 500, \u0026quot;businessRulesType\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;CHEAPER_AMOUNT\u0026quot; } }  [Default Settings] Group or client database settings\n\u0026quot;settings\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;context\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;CONTEXT\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;client\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;client\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;timeout\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;search\u0026quot;: 18000, \u0026quot;quote\u0026quot;: 25000, \u0026quot;book\u0026quot;: 180000 }, \u0026quot;language\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;en\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;currency\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;EUR\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;nationality\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ES\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;market\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;ES\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;businessRules\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;optionsQuota\u0026quot;: 0, \u0026quot;businessRulesType\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;CHEAPER_AMOUNT\u0026quot; } }  If we send a Query with the previous HotelX Settings, the configuration that will be sent to the supplier is:\n Context: \u0026ldquo;CONTEXT\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;//From DB Default Settings\n Language: \u0026ldquo;en\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;//From HotelX Query/Mutation Settings\n Currency: \u0026ldquo;EUR\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;//From Access Settings in Query/Mutation (Base Settings)\n Nationality: \u0026ldquo;ES\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;//From DB Default Settings\n Market: \u0026ldquo;ES\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;//From DB Default Settings\n Timeout: 18000\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;//From HotelX Query/Mutation Settings  AuditTransactions: true\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;//From Supplier Settings in Query/Mutation (Base Settings)\n BusinessRules/OptionQuota: 0\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;//From Access DB Settings (Base Settings)\n BusinessRules/BusinessRulesType: \u0026ldquo;CHEAPER_AMOUNT\u0026rdquo;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;\u0026nbsp;//From Access DB Settings (Base Settings)\n  Plugins As you can observe in GraphQL API Specifications, the input field \u0026ldquo;plugins\u0026rdquo; allows to insert plugins that will be executed during execution process.\nDefault Plugins Additionally, it is possible to load default plugins in our database. Currently, the only way to load these plugins in our database is contacting with our Customer Care team. These default plugins will be executed in all the Queries and Mutations specified above if no filters are specified.\nFilter Plugins Besides, in the Query/Mutation Settings, there is a filter that allows to include or exclude the execution of any plugin. The way it works is similar to the Access Filter in Hotel-Search and it is only allowed specifying includes or excludes, not both. HotelX always reads Query/Mutation input plugins and then joins them to the loaded default plugins of our database, then applies the plugin filters.\n On the one hand, if you specify plugins to be included, these plugins will be executed only if they are found in all the joined plugins (Query/Mutation input plugins in settings and Default plugins from database).\n On the other hand, if you specify plugins be to excluded, these will be deleted from joined plugins and consequently not executed.\n  The way of indicating which plugins we want to include/exclude is introducing Step, Type and Name of the plugin in the Query/Mutation.\n"

Document. Assure that the content you\u0026rsquo;re writting is not duplicated on another page, avoid incosistences. Unify. Don\u0026rsquo;t make assumptions about your reader unless you state the assumptions up front. Don\u0026rsquo;t use absolutes, such as \u0026ldquo;instantaneously,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;perfectly,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;absolutely,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;totally,\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;100%,\u0026rdquo; unless you can back up what you\u0026rsquo;re saying with documentation. Don\u0026rsquo;t use superlatives, such as \u0026ldquo;the best solution,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;the perfect answer,\u0026rdquo; and so on. Don\u0026rsquo;t use logos or trademarks unless you have explicit permission. Don\u0026rsquo;t make performance claims unless you back them up with current data. This means either external links, or links to benchmarking code. Don\u0026rsquo;t include diagrams or pictures that you have no legal rights to include. Don\u0026rsquo;t alter or truncate TravelgateX Platform product names. For example, it’s HotelX, not hotelX. Don\u0026rsquo;t alter or truncate other names. For example, it\u0026rsquo;s Cloud BigQuery, not BigQuery.  Types of documentation Documentation submitted by contributors is usually one of this types:\n Concept: Helps the user gain deeper understanding of a product or architecture. Concept docs answer questions such as \u0026ldquo;What is X?\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;How does X work?\u0026rdquo; They don\u0026rsquo;t provide specific walkthroughs. It\u0026rsquo;s common the use of blockquotes to quote people. They might contain numbered steps as generic examples, but this is rare.   More info at Writing a Concept doc.\n Tutorial: Walks a user through a real-world, industry-specific, or end-to-end development scenario that uses your product. Tutorials teach \u0026ldquo;how to do Y in the context of ABC.\u0026rdquo; Tutorials contain numbered steps that prescribe what to do. They can have enough supporting conceptual information, interspersed among the steps, to help the reader understand what they\u0026rsquo;re doing, why they\u0026rsquo;re doing it, and how and why it works. The end result is a working example. Usually, code on GitHub supports the document.   More info at Writing a Tutorial.\n Reference: Programming concept explanation. Reference relates to an specific topic. References must have a title, an overview with a general explanation and an generic example on a code block. They must be listed the fields available (if it applies) and will include if the field is required and optional values. Finally it will be related if it\u0026rsquo;s required by any other topic (if it applies).   More info at Writing a Reference doc\n Plugin: The plugins must have an explanation that indicates on a clear way the bennefits of using it and the improvements that it applies to the general HotelX behaviour. Plugins must have a title, general explanation and \u0026hellip; (This will be completed).   More info at Writing a Plugin doc\nDesigning a doc Just as you design an app before you start coding, designing how your doc works before you write saves you writing time, helps focus your document, and helps to make sure you\u0026rsquo;re giving the reader the right information. A good way to design your document is by outlining.\nAs you develop your outline, ask yourself:\n In one sentence, what is my doc about? You can reuse a version of this sentence as the opener in the doc. What does my reader need to know before they can understand the contents? This question can lead to a set of prerequisites. Why does the reader care? This information will be part of your introduction. Am I building concepts for the reader from most general to most specific? Am I introducing ideas in the right order? Is there anything I can remove? Is there anything missing? Have I made the right assumptions about my audience?  The following sections show the main, top-level organization for the concept and tutorial doc types. Use these sections to start your outlines.\nWriting a Concept doc A Concept doc has these major sections:\n Title Overview  Don\u0026rsquo;t use the heading \u0026ldquo;Overview\u0026rdquo; or any other heading. Just start at the first sentence.  Body  Provides the details. Contains headings and subheadings as needed to make the content easy to skim.   Example: GraphQL Overview\nWriting a Tutorial A Tutorial doc has these major sections. Items in bold below are literal heading names:\n Title Overview\n First sentence tells what the page is about Tell the user what they\u0026rsquo;re going to learn and provide any concise background information that\u0026rsquo;s helpful. Don\u0026rsquo;t use the heading \u0026ldquo;Overview.\u0026rdquo; Just get right to it.  Objectives\n A short, bulleted list of what the tutorial teaches the reader.  Before you begin\n A numbered list of steps required to set up for the tutorial. Any general prerequisites. Don\u0026rsquo;t assume anything about the user\u0026rsquo;s environment. Assume that the user has only basic operating system installed. If doing the tutorial requires the user to have a specific environment, state what is required. For easy-to-install environment bits, just give them the instructions, such as \u0026ldquo;Run apt-get install…\u0026rdquo;. For more complex setups, link to official documentation.  Costs (optional)\n Tell the reader which technologies will be used and what it costs to use them. Link to the Pricing Calculator, preconfigured, if possible. If there are no costs to be incurred, state that.  Body\n Use as many headings and subheadings as needed. Use numbered steps in each section. Start each step with the action: \u0026ldquo;Click,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Run,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;Enter,\u0026rdquo; and so on. Keep numbered step lists to around 7 or less, if possible. If you need more steps, break it up into subheadings. Provide context and explain what\u0026rsquo;s going on. Use screenshots when they help the reader. Don\u0026rsquo;t provide a screenshot for every step. Show what success looks like along the way. For example, showing console output or describing what happens helps the reader to feel like they\u0026rsquo;re doing it right and help them know things are working so far.  Cleaning up\n Omit this section if you stated there are no costs in the Costs section. Tell the user how to shut down what they built to avoid incurring further costs.   Example: Configure HotelX Security Tutorial\nWriting a Reference doc A Reference doc has these major sections:\n Title Overview  Don\u0026rsquo;t use the heading \u0026ldquo;Overview\u0026rdquo; or any other heading. Just start at the first sentence.  Code block  You can wrap your code between \\\u0026ldquo;\u0026rsquo; and \\\u0026ldquo;\u0026rsquo;  Body  Provides the details. Contains headings and subheadings as needed to make the content easy to skim.   Example: GraphQL AdminMutation\nWriting a Plugin doc A Plugin doc has these major sections:\n Title Overview  Don\u0026rsquo;t use the heading \u0026ldquo;Overview\u0026rdquo; or any other heading. Just start at the first sentence.   (Provisional documentation not finished)\nExample: Aggregation plugin\nVisual assets TravelgateX offers a set of logos and architectural diagram assets for your use:\nhttps://cloud.google.com/icons/\nFile organization in GitHub Follow these guidelines for how to organize your documents:\n If necessary, create a new folder for your document. Name the folder by slugifying your doc\u0026rsquo;s title. You can omit articles such as \u0026ldquo;and\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;the.\u0026rdquo; Name your new doc index.md. Store media in the same folder. i.e. /images as discused here.  For example, if you submit a tutorial named \u0026ldquo;Identity and Access Management\u0026rdquo;:\n Folder name: security URL: https://cloud.google.com/travelgatex/security/identity-access-management  If you don\u0026rsquo;t have any additional files that go along with your tutorial, you can simply make a top-level Markdown file within the security/ folder, e.g. security/identity-access-management.md instead of security/identity-access-manangement/index.md.\nGeneral content guidelines This site seeks technical content. While it\u0026rsquo;s fine and often appropriate to point out the advantages of a particular product or TravelgateX Platform, don\u0026rsquo;t give sales pitches in the document. Here are some guidelines:\n Write for a technical audience. If the document looks like a sales brochure, it\u0026rsquo;s not appropriate as TGX content. Avoid superlatives. Don\u0026rsquo;t say \u0026ldquo;the best,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;amazing,\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;fantastic,\u0026rdquo; and so on. No exclamation points.  Ambiguity Ambiguity is the enemy of technical content. Re-read what you\u0026rsquo;ve written to check whether it can be read to mean more than one thing.\nRepetition Avoid needless repetition. Telling the reader a fact one time usually suffices.\nGeneral style guidelines Here are style guidelines to help you craft a great article.\nAcronyms Don’t create acronyms from product or feature names. Only use acronyms that your audience is familiar with. The A–Z word list has guidelines for many common acronyms, and some acronyms are so widely used that they’re in The American Heritage Dictionary.\nFor example: Conversation as a platform (CaaP) has the potential to make booking a flight as easy as sending a text message. Developers are also looking to CaaP to make computing more accessible to users of all abilities. Learn how to connect a USB device to your Microsoft Surface.\nHeadings Use headings to organize your page into sections and subsections. Headings make it easier for readers to skim and understand what the article is about. Capitalize only the first word and product names in your headings.\nAvoid using an acronym for the first time in a title or heading, unless it’s a keyword that you need to place in the title or heading for SEO. If the first use of the acronym is in a title or heading, introduce the acronym (in parentheses, following the spelled-out term) in the following body text.\nFor example:\nCreating a new object\nNot:\nCreating a New Object\nLists Lists help make your page more scannable.\nNumbered lists Use numbered lists when it\u0026rsquo;s essential that the items be done in a specific order. Otherwise, use a bulleted list. Don\u0026rsquo;t use a numbered list as a way to count the things in the list.\nFor example:\n Do this. Do that. Do another thing.  Not:\nThere are three colors that I like:\n Red Blue Yellow  Think about the order. When writing instructions, give the reader orientation cues in the proper order. Think about moving someone\u0026rsquo;s eyes around the screen.\nFor example:\n\u0026ldquo;Click the OK button in the Cloud Console, on the VM instances page, in the Compute Engine section.\u0026rdquo;\nNot this, because it causes someone to visually search backwards:\n\u0026ldquo;Click the OK button in the Compute Engine section of the VM instances page of the Cloud Console.\u0026rdquo;\nBulleted lists Use bulleted lists for lists that don\u0026rsquo;t imply a sequence. End each item with a period if the item is a sentence or a phrase. Don\u0026rsquo;t use periods for lists of single words or if the list contains only product names.\nFor example:\nI have three favorite colors:\n Red Blue Yellow  Parallelism Try to keep your language across list items in a similar format. For example, start each item with a noun or a verb, but don\u0026rsquo;t mix the formats.\nFor example:\n Write the docs. Write them well. Enjoy the process.  Not:\n Write the docs. The docs should be great. You can have fun writing the docs.  Tables Tables are a great way to help the reader compare a set of items, such as mutually exclusive options. Tables work well when there\u0026rsquo;s a consistent set of properties for each item in a list.\nUse the parallelism principle previously described for table headings and the first column.\nImages A well-designed diagram or a screen shot can save you a lot of writing and help the reader better understand a complex idea. Make sure any text is legible at the display size in the doc (800 pixels wide or less). If the image itself becomes too complex, consider breaking it up into more than one picture.\n Don\u0026rsquo;t use images you don\u0026rsquo;t have rights to use. Don\u0026rsquo;t store the images in the same folder where your document\u0026rsquo;s index.md file is stored, images must be saved in current_folder/images. Don\u0026rsquo;t embed SVG images on the .md files, so the SVG images must be in a separate svg file under /images dir.  Code Format code, command lines, paths, and file names as code font.\nLinking Provide inline links to relevant information, where appropriate. For example, link to:\n \u0026ldquo;One source of truth\u0026rdquo; content. Anything that\u0026rsquo;s likely to go out of date quickly if you copied it into your article. Information that gives more depth than is appropriate for the current context.  Provide direct links to pages in the Google Cloud Console when you give Cloud Console-based instructions. These deep links save the reader time spent looking for the right page and can save you time writing descriptions of how to find the page. Deep links open the page with the project set to the user\u0026rsquo;s last-used project.\n Write short link text (four or fewer words) that\u0026rsquo;s descriptive and includes keywords. If it works, use the title or description of the target page as link text. Link to background and related information rather than summarizing it.  Formatting common text elements    Element Convention Example     Database names Bold. The capitalization of database names varies Contoso database   Emphasis It’s OK to use italic formatting sparingly for emphasis Cybercriminals might call you and claim to be from Microsoft. Be aware that Microsoft will never call you to charge for security or software fixes.   New terms Italicize the first mention of a new term if you\u0026rsquo;re going to define it immediately in text Profile may consist of buyer or seller   Products, services, apps, and trademarks Usually title-style capitalization HotelX\nStats    Markdown usage This site uses Markdown when publishing tutorial content. The site recognizes basic Markdown with a few extensions and edge cases.\nAutolinks Publishing recognizes and adds links to URLs without http:// or https:// prefixes when they are delimited by whitespace, parentheses, or text formatting characters (*_~). Do not use \u0026lt; and \u0026gt; delimiters for these, as they will be stripped out as raw HTML.\nDisallowed Raw HTML Publishing strips all possible HTML from tutorial content, essentially anything contained within \u0026lt; and \u0026gt; delimiters. Note that this is stricter than standard GFM, which only strips certain \u0026ldquo;unsafe\u0026rdquo; HTML.\nStrikethrough Publishing formats text delimited in tildes (~) as strikethrough, making ~a bad example~ look like ~a bad example~ in your document.\nTables Publishing formats text blocks as tables if they have consistent pipe (|) separators and a second delimiter row with just hyphens (-), optionally using : to specify left, right, or centered alignment. Publishing converts this:\n| Table | header | row | default is centered | | :---- | :----: | --: | ------------------- | | Table | data | row | default is left |  into this:\n   Table header row default is centered     Table data row default is left    You cannot create multi-line cells (although other Markdown dialects allow this), and while you can omit both the initial and final pipe separators, it can break table recognition if the first cell looks like a list item.\nGraphics and Theme Learn enhances On our Hugo server we\u0026rsquo;ve got a theme that extends some shortcodes on Markdown.\nFlowchart example {{\u0026lt; mermaid align=\u0026quot;left\u0026quot; \u0026gt;}} graph LR; A[Hard edge] --\u0026gt;|Link text| B(Round edge) B --\u0026gt; C{Decision} C --\u0026gt;|One| D[Result one] C --\u0026gt;|Two| E[Result two] {{\u0026lt; /mermaid \u0026gt;}}  This code is rendered as:\ngraph LR;\rA[Hard edge] --|Link text| B(Round edge)\rB -- C{Decision}\rC --|One| D[Result one]\rC --|Two| E[Result two]\r\rSequence example {{\u0026lt; mermaid \u0026gt;}} sequenceDiagram participant Alice participant Bob Alice-\u0026gt;\u0026gt;John: Hello John, how are you? loop Healthcheck John-\u0026gt;John: Fight against hypochondria end Note right of John: Rational thoughts \u0026lt;br/\u0026gt;prevail...

You should instead use indentation to signify code within lists.\nVoice and tone Active voice Use active voice. Active voice makes it obvious who is performing the action, which makes your writing clearer and stronger.\nFor example:\n\u0026ldquo;The logging agent writes a line to the log file.\u0026rdquo;\nNot:\n\u0026ldquo;A line is written in the log file by the logging agent.\u0026rdquo;\nIt\u0026rsquo;s okay to use passive voice when you\u0026rsquo;d have to go out of your way to use active voice. For example, sometimes you don\u0026rsquo;t need to include the actor in the sentence because the actor isn\u0026rsquo;t relevant. Just use passive voice, instead.\nFor example:\n\u0026ldquo;RFID tag readers are typically positioned in multiple locations in a retail store.\u0026rdquo;\nNot:\n\u0026ldquo;System engineers typically place RFID tag readers in multiple locations in a retail store.\u0026rdquo;\nDirect Speak to the reader. Documentation reads better if you speak to the reader in the second person. That means use \u0026ldquo;you\u0026rdquo; and avoid \u0026ldquo;I\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;we.\u0026rdquo;\nFor example:\n\u0026ldquo;Now load your data into BigQuery. Follow these steps: \u0026hellip;\u0026rdquo;\nNot:\n\u0026ldquo;Now we\u0026rsquo;ll load the data into BigQuery.\u0026rdquo;\nPresent tense Keep to present tense. Avoid using future or past tenses.\nFor example:\n\u0026ldquo;The Cloud Console downloads a JSON file to your computer.\u0026rdquo;\nNot:\n\u0026ldquo;The Cloud Console will download a JSON file to your computer.\u0026rdquo;\nSimple Keep it simple. Use short, simple sentences. They are easier for readers to parse and understand. Omit unnecessary words.\nFor example:\n\u0026ldquo;Click Change to set a new owner.\u0026rdquo;\nNot:\n\u0026ldquo;It is possible for you to set a different owner by clicking the Change button.\u0026rdquo;\nAlso, keep your paragraphs short and to the point. On the web, people skim more and expect shorter content than when they read books. Five sentences or less per paragraph is a good guideline.\nIf a sentence is long, even with straightforward word choices, break it up into multiple, shorter sentences.\nRe-read what you wrote and then eliminate all the unnecessary words.\nIncluding source code If you would like to include source code within your tutorial, you have two options:\nOption 1 Just embed the source code directly in the tutorial. Wrap the code in three backticks or indent by four spaces to achieve proper formatting.\nThis option is the simplest, but offer no way to test the code, and does not allow the user to view actual source code files as they might exist in a real project.\nFor an example, see Run Koa.js on Google App Engine Flexible Environment.\nOption 2 Instead of a Markdown file in the tutorials/ directory, create a folder for your files. The Markdown for the tutorial should be in an index.md file within the new folder, and the rest of the source code files must be in the new folder as well. You can use EmbedMd to include snippets from the source code files in the Markdown file. You should run the embedmd program on index.md to actually include the code block in the Markdown source in one of the commits for your pull request.\nThis option is more complicated, but allows us to test the code, and allows the user to view real source code files.\nFor an example, see Using Node.js to Calculate the Size of a BigQuery Dataset.\nWriting resources Learn more about strong writing.\n What is plain language?

	"content": " How to upload data to the platform There are two ways of uploading data to the platform:\n Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) GraphQL mutation  We recommend continuing to use SFTP at present while we build out more GraphQL resources.\nWhile you can make your updates via a mutation, we have not yet written up resources to show you how to do that.\nIf you require these resources immediately, please contact us via Slack, Jira or by raising an issue in GitHub.\n\rSecure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP) SFTP, or Secure File Transfer Protocol, is a network protocol that provides secure access, transfer, and management of data files programmatically. This protocol is used by the largest organizations in finance, technology, and consulting to transfer data such as Personally Identifiable Information (PII) to ensure it remains 100% secure.\nSecurity To ensure the security of your data, we adhere to the highest standards in data security. Some of the advanced security measures we take include:\n Password-based authentication. IP Whitelisting: We whitelist the IP Addresses from where you\u0026rsquo;ll be accessing your SFTP server to ensure you are the only one allowed to access your account. Anomaly Detection: To ensure no loss of data, we detect anomalies in your uploads to the SFTP server and immediatly warn you when an upload is about to significantly change your account. Encryption: Data is encrypted, keeping your information safe and private.  Setup To get your FTP Credential Details raise a customer care request in Jira Service Desk.\nNaming Conventions Keep in mind that the file is loaded using a specific name, depending on the data being uploaded. For the appropriate file name, please see the specific file documentation in each API product section.\nRemember to always overwrite the last file, because only the last file will be loaded into the platform.\nIf in some case you need to revert to an old version, don\u0026rsquo;t worry because we keep a copy of the old files.\n\rGraphQL Mutation Resources to help you upload your data via GraphQL mutation are coming soon. Please submit an issue to our issue tracker if you require these resources immediately.\n\r"

Changelogs: Documents containing a chronologically ordered list of notable changes. We have:  A general platform changelog with common changes Product specific changelogs hosted at TravelgateX/Release Notes or directly at the Product Space/Release Notes (if exists) for example: https://docs.travelgatex.com/hotelx/release-notes/changelog/ You can find an specific instructions to fill the changelog on this document.  GraphQL Schema Changes: Is a list of recent and upcoming changes to our GraphQL API schema. Deprecated Schema Changes: Specific list of changes that can break existing queries to the GraphQL API. Deleted Schema Changes: Contains a changes history of deprecated notes previously announced.  How to keep a good changelog General Principles What is a changelog? A changelog is a file which contains a curated, chronologically ordered list of notable changes for each version of a project.\nWhy keep a changelog? To make it easier for users and contributors to see precisely what notable changes have been made on the project.\nWho needs a changelog? People do. Whether consumers or developers, the end users of software are human beings who care about what\u0026rsquo;s in the software. When the software changes, people want to know why and how.\nHow do I make a good changelog? Guiding Principles  changelogs are for humans, not machines. The same types of changes should be grouped. Versions and sections should be linkable. The latest changes comes first. The release date of each is displayed.  Types of changes  Added for new features. Changed for changes in existing functionality. Deprecated for soon-to-be removed features. Removed for now removed features. Fixed for any bug fixes. Security in case of vulnerabilities.  How can I reduce the effort required to maintain a changelogs document? Keep an Unreleased section at the top to track upcoming changes.\nThis serves two purposes: - People can see what changes they might expect in upcoming releases - At release time, you can move the Unreleased section changes into a new release version section.\nCan changelogs be bad? Yes. Here are a few ways they can be less than useful.\nDo not document commit log diffs Using commit log diffs as changelogs is a bad idea: they\u0026rsquo;re full of noise. Things like merge commits, commits with obscure titles, documentation changes, etc.\nThe purpose of a commit is to document a step in the evolution of the source code. Some projects clean up commits, some don\u0026rsquo;t.\nThe purpose of a changelog entry is to document the noteworthy difference, often across multiple commits, to communicate them clearly to end users.\nDo not ignore deprecations When people upgrade from one version to another, it should be painfully clear when something will break. It should be possible to upgrade to a version that lists deprecations, remove what\u0026rsquo;s deprecated, then upgrade to the version where the deprecations become removals.\nIf you do nothing else, list deprecations, removals, and any breaking changes in your changelog.\nAvoid confusing dates Regional date formats vary throughout the world and it\u0026rsquo;s often difficult to find a human-friendly date format that feels intuitive to everyone. The advantage of dates formatted like 2017-07-17 is that they follow the order of largest to smallest units: year, month, and day. This format also doesn\u0026rsquo;t overlap in ambiguous ways with other date formats, unlike some regional formats that switch the position of month and day numbers. These reasons, and the fact this date format is an ISO standard, are why it is the recommended date format for changelog entries.\nChangelog example # Changelog All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. {{% release-notes-container type=\u0026quot;u\u0026quot; %}} - \u0026quot;How do I make a changelog?\u0026quot; section. {{% / release-notes-container %}} ## 2017-06-20 {{% release-notes-container type=\u0026quot;a\u0026quot; %}} - New visual identity by @tylerfortune8. - Version navigation. - Links to latest released version in previous versions. - \u0026quot;Why keep a changelog?\u0026quot; section. {{% / release-notes-container %}} {{% release-notes-container type=\u0026quot;c\u0026quot; %}} - Start versioning based on the current English version at 0.3.0 to help translation authors keep things up-to-date. - Rewrite \u0026quot;What makes unicorns cry?\u0026quot; section. {{% / release-notes-container %}} {{% release-notes-container type=\u0026quot;r\u0026quot; %}} - Section about \u0026quot;changelog\u0026quot; vs \u0026quot;change log\u0026quot;. {{% / release-notes-container %}} ## 2015-12-03 {{% release-notes-container type=\u0026quot;a\u0026quot; %}} - RU translation. - pt-BR translation. - es-ES translation. {{% / release-notes-container %}} ## 2015-10-06 {{% release-notes-container type=\u0026quot;a\u0026quot; %}} - Answer \u0026quot;Should you ever rewrite a change log?\u0026quot;. {{% / release-notes-container %}} {{% release-notes-container type=\u0026quot;c\u0026quot; %}} - Improve argument against commit logs. - Start following [SemVer](http://semver.org) properly. {{% / release-notes-container %}}  View an example\nReference table    Types of changes Level Code     Added H3 {{% release-notes-container type=\u0026ldquo;a\u0026rdquo; %}} LIST {{% / release-notes-container %}}   Changed H3 {{% release-notes-container type=\u0026ldquo;c\u0026rdquo; %}} LIST {{% / release-notes-container %}}   Deprecated H3 {{% release-notes-container type=\u0026ldquo;d\u0026rdquo; %}} LIST {{% / release-notes-container %}}   Removed H3 {{% release-notes-container type=\u0026ldquo;c\u0026rdquo; %}} LIST {{% / release-notes-container %}}   Fixed H3 {{% release-notes-container type=\u0026ldquo;f\u0026rdquo; %}} LIST {{% / release-notes-container %}}   Security H3 {{% release-notes-container type=\u0026ldquo;s\u0026rdquo; %}} LIST {{% / release-notes-container %}}   Unreleased H2 {{% release-notes-container type=\u0026ldquo;u\u0026rdquo; %}} LIST {{% / release-notes-container %}}    Writing resources Learn more about changelogs and release notes.\n Keep a changelog  "

You can also refer to the overarching core concepts that apply to all TravelgateX APIs.\nSupplier Product segmentation over a Supplier API implementation. Each Supplier has a Supplier code. These are unique values and they are used consistently throughout all TravelgateX implementations. See our Supplier database, or ask us via our Jira Service desk for a list of Supplier codes.\nAccess Configuration used when interacting with a Supplier, which includes:\n URLs  Credentials  Markets  Rate Types  Specific Supplier settings   Client Client codes are consistent throughout all TravelgateX implementations. These codes are used to identify the business that is making the request and to confirm that the business has a configuration assigned to it.\nContext Context is the way codes are formed and used in implementations. Each Profile (either a Buyer or Supplier) can manage their own contexts or reuse existing ones. Different buyers or sellers can also manage the same codes context. For example, the SupplierSmyRooms uses SMY contexts for their implementations.\nContext applies to:\n Hotel Codes  Board Codes  Room Codes   With our built-in solution, you are able to choose the context that you wish to use when requesting a HotelX operation. For example, if you are a Buyer, you can map your context to your Suppliers\u0026rsquo; contexts.\nShould you be using the aggregator mode, we recommend that you use the widest Context possible (the one that includes more portfolio) or that you use your own context - in doing so, all supplier mappings will be solved/unified.\nFor more information on setting contexts, check out our Plugin guide on Mapping.\r"

In case an error of this type is received, you should first contact the supplier directly on a commercial level and check with them whether there should be availability for the product you are trying to obtain with the specific search criteria (dates, passenger quantity, passenger age, destination you have chosen, etc.). In case the supplier confirms that there should be availability but you are still not obtaining it, you should contact our Customer Care department.\n"

	"content": " What is GraphQL? GraphQL is a query language for your API. It was first designed by Facebook. It\u0026rsquo;s a new way of dealing with and managing data models via API, and is especially useful for decoupling client from server logic.\n GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for fulfilling those queries with your existing data. GraphQL provides a complete and understandable description of the data in your API, gives clients the power to ask for exactly what they need and nothing more, makes it easier to evolve APIs over time, and enables powerful developer tools. graphql.org\nGraphQL uses a server-side runtime for executing queries by using a type system you define for your data. GraphQL isn\u0026rsquo;t tied to any specific database or storage engine and is instead backed by your existing code and data. graphql.org/learn\nA GraphQL query is a string that is sent to the server to be interpreted and fulfilled, which then returns JSON back to the client. Lee Byron, Facebook\n GraphQL at TravelgateX GraphQL is a perfect fit for all of our application needs:\n Scalable: GraphQL is able to handle millions of requests. Stable: GraphQL allows us to keep building our API products and introduce new changes to our APIs that do not break existing integrations in client applications. Fast: GraphQL not only allows faster response times by letting you choose exactly what you want, but it also consumes less bandwidth which makes responses lighter.  We are focused on delivering the best APIs to our clients. SOAP APIs are long gone and modelling REST APIs to fit a vast variety of products is not only hard to understand, it also gets harder to manage as the data model gets bigger. At TravelgateX, we\u0026rsquo;re true believers of the Kaisen philosophy. We\u0026rsquo;re constantly researching for new ways to improve.\n \u0026ldquo;GraphQL allows us to think of our APIs as a whole, giving us a coherence across all of our products and services, which are accessible from one single endpoint. It is the ideal showcase for all of our innovative API products.\u0026rdquo; Oscar Perez, CTO\n Join us on Slack to talk with us about learning to use GraphQL and any questions you might have, or skills you would like to share with our community. You can also send us a Jira service desk request. If you would like any new features or more information in our Learning GraphQL documentation, send us an issues request.\r"

	"content": " This section provides an overview of Identity and access management.\nTravelgateX identity and acccess management lets administrators authorize who can take action on specific resources, giving you full control and internal visibility to manage resources centrally.\nIdentity and access management provides an unified view of your security policy across your entire organization, with built-in auditing to ease compliance processes.\nAs an administrator, when you register with us, we provide you with login details to access your TravelgateX account, including a username and password. As administrator, you can then add additional users to your account and grant them specific access.\nIdentity and access management lets you manage access control by defining who Member has what kind of access Role to each resource:\nConcepts related to identity You grant access to members which can be either:\n Users: A developer, administrator or any other person from your Organisation who interacts with the TravelgateX Platform. An email address can be used as the identity of a User.\n Service Accounts: An application (Client) instead of an individual User. If you prefer, you can create as many Service Accounts as needed to represent different logical components of your application.\n  Concepts related to access management When an authenticated member attempts to make a request, the IAM policy will decide if the member is allowed to perform the operation requested.\nResources and Groups You can grant access to member for each resource or set of resources. Some examples of common resources are Suppliers, Accesses and Clients.\nGroups are organized hierarchically, where the Organization node is the root node in the hierarachy, the folders are the children of the organization and the products are the children of the folders.\nHierarchy assignment Resources are assigned to groups and propagated by groups hierarchically from bottom to top.\nPermissions and Roles Permissions determine what operations are allowed on a resource.\nA role is a collection of permissions. You cannot assign a permission to the member directly; instead you grant them a role. When you grant a role to a user, you grant them all the permissions that the role contains.\nCommon roles include: - Viewer: Allows a User to make Queries of resources, but not change any data - Editor: Allows a User to make Mutations (changes) to the data - Special: In your admin account, you can create special roles that might allow some of your users to only access specific resources. For example, if you have a large team and have divided them based on suppliers, you may choose to only grant each User access to the resources for a specific Supplier.\nYou can grant roles to members, which define who has what type of access. A policy is attached to a resource and identifies which member role is applied to every resource.\nFor more information about Identity and access management configuration, check out our tutorial How-to configure HotelX permissions\u0026gt;\r"

Otherwise, you can use the following Apikey for test purposes:\n64780338-49c8-4439-7c7d-d03c2033b145\n\r\r Search By means of the following query, you will be able to perform an availability search for a given specific criteria. Modify \u0026ldquo;criteriaSearch\u0026rdquo; fields using valid dates and press the button play to send the query.\n\r\r In case you need to replicate the search, there is a possibility to do so by using our token (see second tab). This token is obtained in the response of a search query and you will find it in each of the options returned.\nQuote This query aims to return the total price and cancellation policies of the option selected in the previous step. In the Query Variables, modify the optionRefId with the option id value returned in the search response and send the query:\n\r\r In this case, you can modify the language, if you don’t indicate the language, it uses the same language of search.\nBook This query allows you to book a previously quoted option. In the Query Variables, modify the optionRefId with the optionRefId value returned in the quote response and send the query with the other mandatory information:\n-- \r\r Cancel This query allows you to perform a book cancellation. In Query Variables, you should introduce all the necessary information of the book that you want to cancel:\n-- \r\r Booking List You can retrieve the reservation details and status by performing one of the following three options (see tabs): 1. References - Introducing reservation locators 2. Per booking dates 3. Per arrival dates\n-- \r\r\n"

	"content": " What are Queries \u0026amp; Mutations There are two basic operations in GraphQL schemas:  Queries: Requesting data from a data model. An example Query would be: checking availability of hotels for a particular date and location  Mutations: Making changes and carrying out transactions on data in the data model. An example Mutation would be: making a booking to reserve a hotel room on a particular date.\nQueries Queries ask the system to provide some data, based on specfic parameters. This operation reads values from the server using a GraphQL Object and returns JSON text as a response.\nQueries are interactive. You can use our API Playground to test your queries.\nOur HotelX Getting Started guide shows you how to make queries to search for available hotels and get quotes.\rMutations Mutations are methods that change the data on the server. That is, mutations make a physical change to the data. This can include inserting a new object in a database, or deleting, or updating a data record.\nOur HotelX Getting Started guide shows you how to make mutations to book and cancel reservations.\rJoin us on Slack to talk with us about how to use HotelX in your websites, apps, and products.

This plugin reads information of commissions from ftp. It is mandatory to load at least supplier\u0026rsquo;s commission file. Depending of the files in ftp, this plugin can apply two different commission values over prices. Suppliers commission file specifies the commission applied to supplier’s prices. Hotel commission file specifies the commission applied to the specific hotel’s price. In the one hand, if no hotels commission file is loaded in ftp, it\u0026rsquo;s applied the net price with the commission specified in commissions supplier\u0026rsquo;s file. In other hand, if the hotel\u0026rsquo;s commission file is loaded, this has preference over the supplier\u0026rsquo;s file. These files have to meet the requirements listed below. In other cases, an error will be returned.\nFiles needed to use this plugin  Commission supplier file format (Mandatory)\n Commision hotel file format (Optional)\n  Execution example { \u0026quot;plugins\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;step\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;RESPONSE_OPTION\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pluginsType\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;NET_PRICE\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;net_priceX\u0026quot; } ] } }  CommissionX Goals CommissionX is a plugin with an extended funcionality over net price plugin that allows to apply more complex bussines rules. This plugin defines the contracted / expected commission in cases where the supplier is not able to send it via integration. These commissions are defined through the plugin so as not to lose the options in which we do not know the type of price sent, since this information is established at contract level between client-supplier. Different commissions can be applied according to the different rules depending on the format that we will describe next.\nObservation\nAlthough the group file is optional if this file is informed before the commission file the values will be used from the group file.\nFiles needed to use this plugin  Sequential Commission file format (Mandatory). If the columns chainCodes,destinationCodes are informed then it is mandatory to upload group file.\n Group file format (Optional)\n This file will be necessary in case you want to apply rules depending on a grouping of codes that depend on a context. For this case, it is necessary that you pass with the entity.   How we make it We read sequentially the commission file if the columns chainCodes,destinationCodes are informed then it is mandatory to upload group file to be able to read these values from the group file.\nPossible values entity filename    Entity chainCodes destinationCodes hotelCodes     hotel Yes Yes No   destination Yes No Yes    Execution example { \u0026quot;plugins\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;step\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;RESPONSE_OPTION\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pluginsType\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;NET_PRICE\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;commission\u0026quot; } ] } }  "

	"description": "Basic concepts for all of the TravelgateX platform",
	"content": " The TravelgateX platform and APIs all use a consistent set of basic concepts so that whatever API you use on our platform, you can be confident that it will work with the same definitions as all of the others you are familiar with.\nHere is an overview of the key concepts of our platform.\nAccess An Access is a set of credentials and the authentication configuration that enables a Buyer to access a Supplier. To gain access, a Buyer needs to confirm with TravelgateX that they have an agreement in place with each Supplier with whom they want to integrate.\nAPI Gateway Our API gateway is stable, secure, fault tolerant and load balanced between many datacenters from four different cloud providers: Microsoft Azure, Google Cloud Platform, Hetzner and TotalUptime. We provide realtime details of our uptime and status on our Status page and work at maintaining a minimum 99.99% service performance level.\nOur API gateway provides a single GraphQL endpoint which can be used to make queries against all of our APIs and travel services. This makes it easier for your clients (websites, applications and any other interface) to only call for the exact data that is needed, without parsing a heap of extra information in each API call. (Check out our GraphQL resources to learn more!)\nProfile An Organization uses profiles to determine what type of interaction is required on TravelgateX. At present, profiles are either a Buyer or a Seller.\nBuyer A Buyer Profile uses the TravelgateX platform to book travel services such as hotels for their customers. Buyers include online travel agents, tour operators, niche travel service providers, and travel and pricing apps.\nSeller A Seller Profile uses the TravelgateX platform to sell travel services such as hotels for their customers. Sellers include tour operators, niche travel service providers..\nOrganization An Organization is made up of Partners, Resources, Settings, Permissions and other Metadata.\nPartner A Partner interacts with the TravelgateX API platform. A partners can be a User (that is, a person) or a Service Account (that is, an application). A partner is a member of an Organization, and can be a member of mutiple organizations.\nSupplier A Supplier uses the TravelgateX platfrom to make travel services available to buyers. Suppliers can be suppliers with realtime databases of hotel room vacancies, tours, car rental providers, adventure and activity service suppliers, travel insurance providers or other travel industry service suppliers.\nContext A Context refers to the Supplier codes the request is using. It\u0026rsquo;s a way of specifiying which Supplier codes are being used so they can be transformed and standardized.\nCommon Resources Common resources define common objects that are consistent across all of our API products.\nHUB HUB is the command center of the TravelgateX platform. All connections pass through the HUB.\nProduct A Product is a TravelgateX platform API which is available for the consumption of Resources. We organize our APIs by similarity and common features. Our HotelX API is our first product now available for use in production environments.\nJoin us on Slack to talk with us about how to use TravelgateX APIs in your websites, apps, and products. You can also send us a Jira service desk request. If you would like any new features or more information in our documentation, send us an issues request.\n\r"

We only let a rule to be overriding when it contains at least the criterion: hotel, city or zone. If multiple override rules are valid for an option, the rule with the heavier weight is applied. The hotel criterion is heavier than city, and city is heavier than zone.\nParameters    key value type condition description     channel string optional channel is a rule criterion   applyNegativeCom bool optional if not set or set to false, if the sum of rules percentages is negative the percentage won’t apply   rules json optional an array of rules in json is expected, if found, those rules will apply to each option, doesn’t matter if an option matches the criteria, it will have the rules applied    Files Format In order to manage city and zone criteria, a previous batch load must be done to make a relation with hotel codes.\nTwo file are needed:\nFrom hotel code to his minimum city code:  Encoding: UTF-8  File Name: [Context Source]_Porfolio.csv  Header Row: HotelCode, CityCode Delimiter: Comma (“,”)  Directory: /F[folder code]_[unique code]/HotelX_[unique code]/Markup  Destination trees:  Encoding: UTF-8  File Name: [Context Source]_DestinationsTree.csv  Header Row: DestinationCode, ParentCode, ISOCountryCode  Delimiter: Comma (“,”)  Directory: /F[folder code]_[unique code]/HotelX_[unique code]/Markup   Execution example { \u0026quot;plugins\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;step\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;RESPONSE\\_OPTION\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;pluginsType\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;MARKUP\u0026quot; \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;markupX\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;parameters\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;key\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;channel\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;1000\u0026quot; }, { \u0026quot;key\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;applyNegativeCom\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;value\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;true\u0026quot; } ] } ] } }  "

	"title": "Thinking in GraphQL",
	"tags": [],
	"description": "",
	"content": " A Paradigm Shift GraphQL is a query language, and as such it does exactly that: it queries servers in order to get results back. With GraphQL, you can choose exactly what data you want to retrieve. GraphQL is a typed query language. That means that it has a lot of predictability, as each piece of data has its own type, so we know what sort of data we will be getting back. This is something we really appreciate, especially since we deal with so many third party APIs, and often we have no control of what\u0026rsquo;s going on on the other side! At TravelgateX we take away all of those headaches, by offering you an integration platform to 600+ suppliers, all accessible via a single GraphQL endpoint.\nUnderstanding GraphQL Schemas In GraphQL, the API specifications are called schemas. A GraphQL Schema is a contract between the client and the server. It defines how clients and servers can talk to each other and sets out what they expect from each other. This way, both know exactly what they can and cannot send to each other and what they\u0026rsquo;ll get in response to that.\nThere are a number of ways you can understand our Schema: You can see all elements of our data model by clicking on the green Schema button on the right hand side of our API playground. You can review our Reference Documentation which provides a page by page analysis of all Objects and fields used in our Schema. You can see how all of the data fields are connected by exploring the GraphQL Voyager tool.\nAt TravelgateX we would like to give a hat tip to API Guru and their excellent tool graphql-faker. This helped us write the schema in one window while seeing the results in another window. Besides being a super cool feature, this helped us think through each and every node in our data Schema.\rBuilding Queries You can test a Query in the API playground.\nA query has the following components: Operation type: When searching data in GraphQL, we use Query to indicate the operation type (see below for Mutation operation type) Operation name: (optional) You can give your Query a name so that it is easy to find in later code. This is the similar to creating a function in other programming languages. Variable definitions: You can set what variables need to be completed in order to run your query. You declare a name for the variables you will use by using a $. A common variable name we use is $criteriaSearch. After declaring a variable name, use the colon and then describe what inputs are needed. You can choose from some of the input objects we have already created. For example, we often use the HotelCriteriaSearchInput input object. This input object requires the following fields as mandatory (indicate by a !): Check in date, check out date, number of hotels to be returned in a response, and number of people to occupy the rooms. You can also add language, currency, nationality and market fields as variables to this input object, for more filtered responses. Selection set: After the variables have been defined, you can use the { brackets to start listing what objects you want to query to get the data you need. Each selection set starts with a { and ends with a }. You can nest (indent) these selection sets so it is easier to read a query. Response: Once you have completed defining your query, you will receive a response in JSON format. This will be nested as well, so it is easier to read.\nFurther reading We recommend the following resources to learn more about making GraphQL queries: The Anatomy of a GraphQL query by Sashko Stubailo GraphQL explained by Jonas Helfer Queries and Mutations by GraphQL.org\nBuilding Mutations You can test a Mutation in the API playground. We recommend that you work through our example HotelX mutation to book a hotel.\nA query has the following components: Operation type: When searching data in GraphQL, we use Mutation to indicate the operation type, that is, we are going to change some data on the server Operation name: (optional) You can give your Mutation a name so that it is easy to find in later code. This is similar to creating a function in other programming languages. Variable definitions: You can set what variables need to be completed in order to run your mutation. You declare a name for the variables you will use by using a $. A common variable name we use is $bookInput. After declaring a variable name, use the colon and then describe what inputs are needed. You can choose from some of the input objects we have already created. For example, we often use the HotelBookInput input object. We added an ! in our example. The ! in GraphQL means it is mandatory. So while only three fields of the HotelBookInput are usually mandatory, by adding the ! to our variable definition, we have made all input object fields mandatory. Selection set: After the variables have been defined, you can use the { brackets to start listing what objects you want to query to get the data you need. Each selection set starts with a { and ends with a }. You can nest (indent) these selection sets so it is easier to read a query.  Response: Once you have completed defining your mutation, you will receive a response in JSON format. This will be nested as well, so it is easier to read. Look for the field Status and make sure it has OK to confirm that the data has been added/updated/deleted.\nWe have identified pagination as a topic we need to cover on this page as part of our learning resources. Check our Roadmap for updates on when we will be preparing this content.\nIf you need any additional information for this page, or suggestions on how we can improve our documentation, send us an issue via our Issues Tracker.\n\r"

This entity contains static data about the hotel requested, such as code, name, location, and other information - You can find all these fields in the graph. You can receive hotels with hotel codes or with minimal destination codes, you can also filter the results based on rank. In this sense, note that there are mandatory and optional fields that allow filtering the hotels returned in the response. As for the response, the full response is split into pages: By default, the maximum number of hotels returned in each page (response) is 1000, but it is allowed to request between 100 and 10000 hotels by filling in the field maxSize in the criteria. In order to obtain the next page of hotels, you need to fill in the token field, accordingly. Input parameters are explained above.\nCriteria Mandatory fields\n- access-\u0026gt; It represents the access for which you want to receive the hotels information.\nOptional fields\n- hotelCodes-\u0026gt; it allows to filter by hotel codes\n- ranks-\u0026gt; it allows to filter by ranks\n- maxSize-\u0026gt; it allows to specify the number of elements per page\nToken The token allows to request the next page of hotels. The correct way of obtaining multiple pages of hotels is mantaining this field empty for the first execution, and request the token field in the response graph. Then, send subsequent queries filling in the token field with the value returned in the previous response.\nPlayground Samples  Hotels \r\r  Destinations Destinations Query returns a list of static data about destinations for a supplier access. By default, if you don’t set any destination codes, you will receive all the codes. As it is the case with the Query Hotels, you will be able to receive subsequent pages of destinations by filling in the continuation token field. It is possible that you filter by language and you receive the texts only in the language specified by parameter in DestinationData /texts/languages.\nPlayground Samples  Destinations \r\r  Boards Boards Query returns a simple boards map that can include translations to other languages.\nPlayground Samples  Boards \r\r  Rooms Rooms Query returns a simple rooms map that can include translations to other languages. You can search by room codes, if you don\u0026rsquo;t introduce any room codes, you will receive all of them. The full response is split into pages. By default, the number of rooms in each page is 1000, however, you can choose the size with a value between 100 and 10000.\nCriteria Mandatory fields\n- access-\u0026gt; It represents the access for which you want to receive the room description.\nOptional fields\n- roomCodes-\u0026gt; it allows to filter by room codes\n- maxSize-\u0026gt; it allows to specify the number of elements per page\nToken The token allows to request the next page of rooms. The correct way of obtaining multiple pages of rooms is mantaining this field empty for the first execution and request the token field in the response graph. Then, subsequent queries filling in the token field with the value returned in the previous response.\nPlayground Samples  Rooms \r\r  Categories Category static data returns a simple categories map that can include translations to other languages.\nPlayground Samples  Categories \r\r  "

	"content": " On this page you will learn how to rank hotels.\nOverview On this page, you will learn how to manage content data such as hotels, boards, categories, etc. in your site. Hotel Content operations allow changes to be made into static methods on HotelX, so that hotels can be divided into different rankings or priorities in order to facilitate the mapping process.\nThe main goal of this process is to create a hotel ranking and divide the whole portfolio in order to make the hotel list more manageable. Each classification or sub-list responds to specific commercial criteria, such as direct contracting hotels, the best offers, the best sales, etc.\nOnce the hotel ranking file/s have been uploaded, the static hotel list method can filter hotels according to this ranking. In order to set up hotel ranking lists you must upload a file in csv format using a specific name to identify the ranking in your organisation\u0026rsquo;s FTP.\nFile Names (mandatory) Each file can have different meanings. It\u0026rsquo;s up to the file creator to give it a meaning according to their business needs. In order to process files correctly, they must be named according to the following naming convention:\n   File Name Description     rank1.csv Rank 1, for example direct contracts   rank2.csv Rank 2, for example best deals   rank3.csv Rank 3, for example top sales   rank4.csv Rank 4, for example competitive hotels   rankN.csv Rank N, any type of information.    Header fields (mandatory) In order for them to be correctly processed, the header fields must have the following format:\n   Field Name Data Type     provider_id string   hotel_code string   rank boolean [1,0]    Example:    provider_id hotel_code rank     travelgatex 2018 1   travelgatex 2017 1    Process file To process the file, it must be uploaded to your organization\u0026rsquo;s FTP folder in the TravelgateX Platform. For more info on how to upload files, you can access our data automation section.\nTemplate File Feel free to download a template CSV file.\n"

	"content": " What is TravelgateX? TravelgateX platform provides a single API endpoint for all of our API products. This makes it easy for you to integrate our full travel catalog and services into your applications (regardless of whether you are integrating to a website, mobile app, widget, or other interface). Instead of having to deal with REST APIs, you\u0026rsquo;ll be able to use full poser of GraphQL to interact with your data.\nGraphQL is the future of API development, many big companies (like Facebook, Twitter, Yelp, IBM and more) as well as smaller startups and teams are using it in production already today.\nHow can I use TravelgateX? There are three major ways for using TravelgateX:\n Implement TravelgateX API as a app-to-app communication Access TravelgateX API directly from the frontend Use TravelgateX Site  Which Apikey do I have to use?  I already have the TGX Welcome Pack: Then you should use the Api Key facilitated. I did not receive TGX Welcome Pack: Then you should use our dummy Api Key facilitated on our sample Playground.  "

	"content": " HotelX Settings In HotelX there are different configuration level settings for a request. With these settings, you can configure some aspect of the request:\n   Field Description     context It indicates the context codes that you want to send and to receive.   Timeout It sets the requested timeout in the different query and mutation types:* search * quote * book (includes cancel and booking)    Language The language you want to use in the request.   Currency It indicates the currency you are going to send to the supplier or suppliers.   Nationality It indicates the nationality you are going to send to the supplier or suppliers.   Market It indicates the market you are going to send to the supplier or suppliers.   Business Rules These rules are sent directly via the integration, and they affect the supplier\u0026rsquo;s response.\n* Options Quota: number of options returned via the integration.\n* Type: Choose priority of product    As we have previously stated, we have three ways to indicate these settings.\nWe are going to start with the most specific until the most general.\nSettings per request These settings overwrite all others.\nYou must have permission to overwrite settings, if you don\u0026rsquo;t have this permission you won\u0026rsquo;t be able to change the configuration on runtime, that is, to each request.\nThese fields are the same in the three levels, only that the information is overwritten in lower levels. So, the request settings overwrite all other settings.\nSettings per client The settings in this level are used when you don’t overwrite settings to the request level.\nHowever, if you have the same client in different groups, you can set different settings to each one. In this case, you should specify which group you want to use in the request, in order to choose which configuration to use.\nSettings per HotelX And the last one, settings per HotelX instance. These settings are in the highest level, in the case that you don\u0026rsquo;t have the client\u0026rsquo;s settings and you don\u0026rsquo;t specify them in the request, settings are obtained from HotelX instance, this setting is mandatory.\nHow to execute a plugin A plugin execution can be specified in any request’s HotelSettingsInput and it must specify in which step it should be executed. The plugin type and name are mandatory in order to identify a plugin instance.\n\u0026quot;plugins\u0026quot;: { \u0026quot;step\u0026quot;: PluginStepType, \u0026quot;pluginsType\u0026quot;: [ { \u0026quot;type\u0026quot;: PluginType, \u0026quot;name\u0026quot;: plugin name (its unique), \u0026quot;parameters\u0026quot;: [] } ] }  Develop your own plugin Plugins are a Go language feature and we are using the native package in order to implement them. Therefore, a plugin is simply a go file that contains a set of functions that we will specify, the interface is yet to be defined.\n"
